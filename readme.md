Hello everyone this is a website that I developed with flask, HTML, CSS.

It took me 2 days to learn flask, HTML, CSS and build a website with it So the website has many bugs and 
is not really optimized for devices like mobile phones.

I will not recommend you use it. It is just a personal project I did to learn a new language and test my skills 

I have a lot of work to do to make this website perfect.

Thanks for visiting my profile.
